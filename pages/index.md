I'm a researcher at Inria in the [CASH](http://www.ens-lyon.fr/LIP/CASH/) research
team.

I design programming languages 
that are safe, easy to use, and adapted to specific domains. 
Among other things, I worked
on languages for web programming, operating systems and low-level programming.
I'm particularly interested in static type systems, functional programming,
rich module systems and meta-programming.
My work attempts to marry both the
theoretical aspects of type-systems and semantics of programming languages and
practical consideration, usually leading to an implementation.
See my [publications](publications.html), [CV][] and [research statement][] for details.

Previous positions:
- PhD thesis (see [here](phdthesis.html) for details) at [IRIF][] in the [Ocsigen project][ocsigen]
- The [proglang team](http://proglang.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/)
