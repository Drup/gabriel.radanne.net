I'm a researcher at Inria in the [CASH](http://www.ens-lyon.fr/LIP/CASH/) research
team.

I design programming languages that
allow programmers to write complex programs both easily and safely, and 
adapted to domain-specific use cases.
I'm particularly interested in static type systems, functional programming,
rich module systems and metaprogramming.
My work attempts to marry both the
theoretical aspects of type-systems and semantics of programming languages and
practical consideration, usually leading to an implementation.
See my [publications](publications.html), [CV][] and [research statement][] for details.
