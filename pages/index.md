I'm a postdoc researcher in the
[proglang team](http://proglang.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/)
at the [Computer Science Department of the University
of Freiburg](http://www.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/).

I'm interested in designing better and nicer programming languages that
allow programmers to write complex programs both easily and safely.
For this purpose, I leverage static type systems, functional programming
and rich module systems to provide users with powerful tools that can
be combined with domain-specific approaches.
My work attempts to marry both the
theoretical aspects of type-systems and semantics of programming languages and
practical consideration, usually leading to an implementation.
See my [publications](publications.html), [CV][] and [research statement][] for details.

I did my PhD thesis at [IRIF][] in the [Ocsigen project][ocsigen], under the supervision of [Jérôme Vouillon][] and [Roberto Di Cosmo][]. More details are available [here](phdthesis.html).
