I'm a researcher at Inria in the [Cambium](http://cambium.inria.fr/) research
team. Currently, I'm working on redesigning the OCaml module and type systems.

I'm interested in designing better and nicer programming languages that
allow programmers to write complex programs both easily and safely.
For this purpose, I leverage static type systems, functional programming
and rich module systems to provide users with powerful tools that can
be combined with domain-specific approaches.
My work attempts to marry both the
theoretical aspects of type-systems and semantics of programming languages and
practical consideration, usually leading to an implementation.
See my [publications](publications.html), [CV][] and [research statement][] for details.

Previously, I worked in the
[proglang team](http://proglang.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/)
at the [Computer Science Department of the University
of Freiburg](http://www.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/).
I did my PhD thesis (see [here](phdthesis.html) for details) at [IRIF][] in the [Ocsigen project][ocsigen].
