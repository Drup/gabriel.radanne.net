					Hello. My name is Jon Ludlam and I'd like to give our talk today
					titled 'The Final Pieces of the OCaml Documentation Puzzle'.
				</aside>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h1>Principles</h1>

				<p>Documentation should be...</p>
				<ol>
					<li class="fragment">Correct</li>
					<li class="fragment">Useful</li>
				</ol>
				<p class="fragment">Focus first on <em>static html</em></p>

				<span class="fragment">from <em>module signatures</em></span>
				<aside class="notes">
					<p>This talk is about Odoc, a tool for generating documentation
						from OCaml source code, for which I'm the current overall
						maintainer. In particular I'd like to discuss some
						of the innovations we've been working on over the past year or so
						to make 'Odoc 2.0' that we believe will make this the best tool for documenting
						your OCaml projects.
					</p>
					<p>Let's start by stating some principles of good documentation.</p>

					<p>Documentation should be correct. I hope this is a pretty uncontroversial
						statement!
						It's worth saying though, as the currently released
						version of Odoc produces documentation that is, in a few cases, incorrect
						or suffers from broken links.</p>

					<p>Secondly, it should be useful. By this I mean it's got to show you what you want or need to know
						in an
						obvious way.</p>

					<p>I'd also like to state clearly how the generated documentation will
						be consumed. As with most other code-documentation tools, we will focus
						first on generating static html. As we'll see later, we can then
						adapt this for other output formats such as latex or man pages.</p>

					<p>Finally, we'll be using Module signatures as the basis for generating our documentation.</p>

## Why is this tricky?

- Signatures are a great starting point <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- The text of signatures is not necessarily a great starting point <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Note:
Why is this tricky? Why has it taken such a long time to get even where we are today?

Signatures are indeed a great starting point. Modules are the building blocks of OCaml programs,
and the signature is the surface that is
exposed to other modules. Documenting the signatures by looking at the mli files (or actually the cmti files)
therefore makes a great deal of sense... however.

the actual text of the signature might not be terribly illuminating. Let's look at an example:
</textarea>

			</section>

			<section>
				<section data-markdown>
					<textarea data-template>
```ocaml
(* base/src/sexp_with_comparable.mli *)
include module type of struct
  include Sexp
end

include Comparable.S with type t := t
```

Note:
This is taken from Jane Street's Base library. 
It's a great signature for its intended purpose: constraining the content to be 'correct'.
The aim is extend the s-expression module keeping it compatible with the original.
It begins with this slightly convoluted construct "include module type of struct include Sexp"
to pull in the signature of that module, making sure that the signature is
'strengthened' such that the types we pull in are equal to the types in Sexp.

The extended functionality we want is a standard set of comparison functions, so we pull in the
Comparable.S signature,
using the destructive type substitution 't := t' to make sure the extra functions will be
operating on the correct type.

It's precisely what's needed, no more.

So let's see what ocamldoc makes of it.

				<h2>Ocamldoc output</h2>

					What can we see from this?
					<ul>
						<li>The clickable links - 'Sexp' and 'Comparable.S' that take us to definitions -- are great -
							we certainly want to keep
							this sort of functionality.</li>
						<li>but not much else is great on this page here.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>This doesn't really pass our second principle - it's not very useful. I've no idea from this
						what types and values this module actually contains. We really could do with showing
						what the includes here end up including; the types, the functions and their associated doc
						strings
						- this is what we call 'expansions'</p>
				</aside>

## Expansions

We need to produce **expansions** for:

- Includes
- Modules / module types, when they're not already signatures, e.g.
```ocaml
module M : MODTYPE with type t := u
module N : F(X).T
```
- Classes / Class types

Notes:
It's not just includes that we are going to need to expand. The signatures of modules and module types are often
described by referring to other module types; sometimes with additional type or module equalities or substitutions.
Sometimes they're not; they're just signatures, in which case we don't need to do any extra expanding,
We also need to do some similar expanding for classes and class types; though this is an area we are still
working on, so I'm not going into any detail on this today.

We've also got the option of what to do with the expansions. For includes, we put the expansions inline
in the page. For modules and module types, for HTML, we generally will create a new page with the contents. Different
output formats can decide how to deal with them in different ways too, which we'll come back to later.

We also need to consider how the expansions will affect the destinations of the various clickable
links. The process of deciding this is called 'resolution', and is done both for links found in code,
called 'paths' or 'fragments', and those found in the documentation comments, known as 'references'.

So how are we going to calculate these expansions?

				<section data-markdown>
					<textarea data-template>
## Use the compiler?

The compiler must have calculated the contents of
**Sexp\_with\_comparable**, can we just use that?

Yes, but it only produces a signature 'result'
- No comments!
- No includes, no other structure

Notes:
The first and most obvious thing to do is to see if we can just ask the compiler. Can we get away with just
getting the compiler to all the work and we then just present it? Well, yes and no. We do
indeed get the compiler to do a lot of work and Odoc operates using the typed trees as input -- that
is, rather than reading the mli files (or ml files if nobody has written an mli file), it will
read the cmti files (or cmt files). This has the extremely useful property of ensuring that
we're only dealing with 'correct' input.

However, the problem with these expansions is that what the compiler wants and what we need
are not entirely aligned. The compiler only really cares about the resulting signature, and not what
went into making the signature, whereas we really want to track the provenance of elements
in the signature so we can show where they came from and link back to their definitions.
What the compiler has calculated will have all the includes, the type and module
substitutions, the typeof expressions, simply replaced with their results.
Additionally all of the comments are gone, so the actual documentation is missing, which is definitely
a minus when it comes to producing the docs.

So we need to write our own code to do these expansions.

## Copy the compiler!

Odoc 1.5.1 had a more ad-hoc implementation, causing bugs and
making it hard to adopt new OCaml features

The master branch on github has a brand-new implementation based on
how the compiler does it.

Notes:
The currently released version of Odoc has very clever but quite bespoke
implementation of expansion and resolution. This was very good, but not
perfect, and also hard to understand. This made it tricky to keep up with the
compiler as it added new features and there were some long-standing issues
which were very hard to fix.

Over the past year or so we have implemented "the new model" to do the work
of expansion and resolution, which is based on how the compiler itself works,
whilst keeping better track of where signature elements come from.

One of the most important implications of this approach is that Odoc ends up inheriting
a two-pass approach, corresponding to 'compile' and 'link', which I will talk
a little bit more about in a second.

Let's look
at the output of Odoc 1.5.1 and the current master branch of Odoc working on
our previous example.

				<h2>Odoc 1.5.1 output</h2>
				<img src="images/old-odoc.png" />
				<aside class="notes">
					<p>I'm not using the real S-expression and Comparable modules here, just
						some stubs to show how it works. You can see here that the includes
						have been expanded to show their contents. However, you can also see
						a number of problems here. Firstly there's this odd Lib__Sexp.t -
						there are no source files containing double underscores! Secondly
						I did actually write a docstring for the function `of_string`, which has disappeared.
						Thirdly the destructive type substitution hasn't happened - the expansion
						of `Comparable.S` still has a `type t` in it, and the function `le` below
						contains links to that type t (if you click on them it takes you to
						the line above instead the top definition.</p>

					<p>This fails on principle 1 - it's not correct! So let's now take a quick
						peek at what improvements we've made in master.</p>

				<h2>Odoc master output</h2>

				<h2>Compile/Link</h1>

					<div class="fragment">

						<b>Compile : .cmti / .cmt / .cmi -> .odoc
						</b>
						<p>Requires dependent odoc files (same as standard ocaml compile dependencies)</p>

					</div>

					<div class="fragment">

						<b>Link : .odoc -> .odocl</b>
						<p>Requires odoc files for everything in the package and all
							dependent
							packages</p>
					</div>
					<div class="fragment">

						<span><b>Generate</b>: .odocl -> .html / .tex / man</span>
						<p>No other dependencies</p>
					</div>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>
							In basing our implementation on how the compiler works we need to
							process our inputs in much the same way as the compiler does, and
							we've named them similarly. We
							start by 'compiling' the cmti files into odoc files. As for
							standard compilation, if your module depends upon any other, that
							module will have to have been compiled first to produce its odoc file.
						</p>
						<p>Linking is then performed. When we link we resolve all of the
							references in doc comments, which could be to any module in
							this package or any dependencies. As such linking requires all of
							the odoc files for those to have been compiled.
						</p>
						<p>Once the linking is finished we have self-contained odocl files.
							We're then in a position to use these to generate
							any of our output formats. A single odocl file will often result in
							multiple output files.

			<section>
				<h3>Canonical modules 1</h3>

				<div class="container">

					<div class="col">
						<p>x.mli</p>
						<pre><code class="language-ocaml">type t</code></pre>
						<p>y.mli</p>
						<pre><code class="language-ocaml">type t = X.t</code></pre>
					</div>

					<div class="col">
						<p>lib.ml-gen</p>
						<pre><code class="language-ocaml">(** @canonical Lib.X *)
module X = Lib__X

(** @canonical Lib.Y *)
module Y = Lib__Y
</code></pre>
					</div>
				</div>

				<aside class="notes">
					<p>The long-term goal in OCaml is to do namespacing using the module
						system. We'll pack all the modules to do with a particular library
						into one top-level module and not have to expose the individual
						modules that make it up. Once we've got first-class support for this
						in the language we won't have to worry about canonical modules,
						but for now Odoc has to help maintain the illusion that it's already
						here.</p>

					<p>This is how it works today with dune.</p>

					<p>We write our modules -- here, X and Y, as we'd like them to appear
						within the library namespace. We can refer between them as just
						X and Y as usual, as long as we don't cause dependency loops.
						When we come to compile them though, dune will
						tell the compiler to ignore their filenames and that their names are
						actually `Lib__X` and `Lib__Y`.
						Now, since this would break the inter-module paths like `X.t`,
						dune will actually first generate this new file `lib.ml-gen` that
						contains aliases from the short names 'X' and 'Y' to 'Lib__X' and 'Lib__Y'.
						Now, even though this file refers to lib__X and Y, it can be compiled
						before them with the help of the compiler flag 'no-alias-deps', because
						nothing in the file depends on the contents of those modules. The
						generated file makes a note that to link it will require lib__X and Y
						like normal, but obviously it can't record the hash that it would do normally.
						Then when we compile X and Y (pretending they are lib__X and lib__Y), we
						instruct the compiler
						to 'open' the module Lib, which brings the short names into scope, and
						allows the files to compile as if their names hadn't been mangled.</p>

					<p>When we then want to use this library, we refer to modules `Lib.X`
						and `Lib.Y` and pretend that lib__X and lib__Y don't exist.</p>

					<p>So, how does Odoc deal with this? Because we work the same way as the
						compiler, we deal with this in the same way that the compiler
						does! First, we 'compile' the generated lib
						module. We make note that the paths to 'lib__X' and 'lib__Y' are forward
						paths -- that is, we haven't yet compiled the odoc files corresponding
						to those modules -- and we write out `lib.odoc`. We then compile lib__X and lib__Y. When it
						looks at
						the X.t in module y, because it's operating on the typedtree (the cmti
						rather than mli), it knows that the 'X' is the 'X' from lib.ml. So it
						looks up module X there and notes that it's got a 'canonical' tag in
						front of it, and records this in the path - semantically this means that
						references to that 'X' should be referred to 'Lib.X', and therefore
						the reference to 'X.t' should go to 'Lib.X.t'</p>

					<p>Now that odoc has compiled the files, we get to the link phase. Since
						we're trying to pretend that anything with a double underscore doesn't
						exist, we don't link those files, so the only file we actually link in
						this example is 'Lib'. We look at the module aliases here, and note that
						they are 'self-canonical' - that is, the canonical path to the module
						is in fact this module! We therefore expand the aliases, and splice in
						the signatures from lib__X and lib__Y. We then recursively link these expansions,
						and in this case we'll resolve the X.t path, looking up the canonical path so
						that the link will be to 'Lib.X.t'. We actually do check that the target
						exists to ensure we have no broken paths. For any links that can't be
						resolved, we'll report this and just output text rather than a link.</p>
				</aside>

			<section>
				<h3>Canonical modules 2</h3>
				<div class="container">

					<div class="col">
						<p>x.mli</p>
						<pre><code class="language-ocaml">type t</code></pre>
						<p>y.mli</p>
						<pre><code class="language-ocaml">type t = X.t</code></pre>
					</div>

					<div class="col">
						<p>lib__.ml-gen</p>
						<pre><code class="language-ocaml">(** @canonical Lib.X *)
module X = Lib__X

(** @canonical Lib.Y *)
module Y = Lib__Y
</code></pre>

						<p>lib.mli</p>
						<pre><code class="language-ocaml">(* User-defined Lib module *)
module X = X
module Y = Y
</code></pre>

					</div>


				</div>

				<aside class="notes">
					<p>This is a slightly more advanced namespacing example.</p>
					<p>The difference here is that we've handwritten our 'lib.ml' file,
						and so the generated one is 'lib__.ml'.
						This is more expressive and allows for finer
						control over the top-level module, but now you have to be much
						more careful that the canonical links are correct. As you can see,
						the 'canonical' tags in the generated lib__ file are still pointing
						at 'Lib', so they're pointing into the hand-written file. If you've
						chosen not to expose a module, or you've changed its name, the
						canonical path won't resolve correctly and this can lead to
						unresolved paths. As I mentioned
						previously though, we do check everything and can report if this
						sort of thing is broken.

## Module aliases
We don't make expansions of module aliases.

- Not necessary
- Enormously decreases size of docs

Unfortunately complicates linking to definitions:
```ocaml
module X = Y
type t = X.t
```
</e>
  
Notes:
We don't ordinarily expand module aliases unless they're the
canonical module as in the previous slide. It's not necessary
because module aliases are real aliases, there's no need to
simply duplicate the contents. Additionally it helps reduce
the size of the docs we produce. The downside is that it
complicates linking to definition points. In the example
here, we need to ensure that the link for 'X.t' points at
Y.t while the text of the link remains as 'X.t'

## Intermediate expansions

```ocaml
module type SIG = sig
  type t
end

module type MODTYPE = sig
  module X : SIG
  module Y : SIG
end

module M : MODTYPE with type X.t = foo
```

expansion of module M looks like:

```ocaml
module X : SIG with type t = foo
module Y : SIG
```

Notes:
This is another example of Odoc attempting to keep track
of the provenance of items more carefully than the compiler.
Here we've got a module type SIG that contains an opaque type t.
Then a module type MODTYPE that contains two modules, X and Y,
that have signature SIG. Lastly we declare a module M that
has signature MODTYPE with an additional type equality X.t = foo.

When the compiler evaluates
the signature of module M here, the definition of 'X'
within it is simply replaced with a signature, and we lose the fact that
it came from module type 'SIG' originally. Odoc tries
to be more careful and instead with keep the 'SIG' on 'X', and
instead annotate it with the type equality `t = foo`

## Shadowed items

Feature since OCaml 4.08

```ocaml
include Foo
module Bar = struct
  include Foo.Bar
  let baz = 42
end
```

Notes:
Shadowed items came in in OCaml 4.08 as a way to make overriding included
modules simpler. Here the issue is that we must be very careful in expanding
the include so that we don't accidentally end up with duplicate module 
definitions. In this example, Foo contains a module Bar, which you can see
because we're explicitly referencing it below. We include Foo,
then override Bar, extending it with a new value 'baz'.

## Abstract modules

Clicking on a module should take us to its contents, **if it has any**

Notes:
I mentioned earlier that links taking us to the definition points of items
were really good. In fact, much better is for a link to a module or module type to take
us to the _contents_ of the module. However, to do this we need to check that
the module is not opaque, as then it won't have any expansion and therefore
trying to link to the contents would result in a broken link.

## References

```ocaml
(** {!type:List.t} *)
```

- Paths come from code, references from comments

- References are more expressive
  - can project from module types
  - can refer to many more items
  - can't (yet) apply functors


Notes:
I've not yet talked much about References, which are links to
items found in documentation comments. Obviously the compiler 
simply ignores these entirely so the resolution of these is
entirely up to Odoc. These are mostly more
expressive than the links found in the code, which can only
refer to types, modules, module types, classes and class types.
References can refer to many more objects, such as constructors,
values or record fields, and they can also project elements out
of module types. You can't refer to elements in a functor application,
though this would be simple to add now.

To be as general as possible, references are not resolved until
link time, and thus we can refer to any element defined in the
whole package or dependent packages.

## Dependently-typed modules 

### Normal functors:

```ocaml
module type ARG = sig type t end

module F(X : ARG) : sig
  type u : X.t list
end

module A : sig
  type t = int
end

type t = F(A).u
```

Notes:
Now we're getting a bit more off the beaten track. I'm not
going to go into detail on dependently-typed modules, suffice to say that we have to
be even more careful when functor results depend upon the
module types in their arguments. Please ask me afterwards
if you're interested!

Now, there are some other interesting features, but now I'm going
to move on to how we have added a document intermediate 
representation to allow us to simply generate different
format outputs, such as latex and man pages.

				<h2>The document layer</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>Results from link phase is a typed syntax tree</li>
					<li>Requires 'thinking in OCaml' to traverse</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Solution: transform to generic document IR
				</p>
				<aside class="notes">
					<p>Once we have finally done all the resolving
						and expanding, compiling and linking,
						the output from the model layer is effectively
						a syntax tree that fundamentally has the same
						shape as the typed tree from the original cmti
						file. You have to know quite precisely how OCaml works
						in order to traverse it effectively.
						To simplify backend logic and to reduce code
						duplication, we first transform this syntax tree
						into a document-oriented intermidate representation.

						This is designed such that backends can traverse
						it simply and concentrate on generating the
						appropriate output for the chosen backend type.

						Naturally different output formats have different
						capabilities; HTML can split things into small
						pages with links between them, whereas printed latex-based
						documents should not be treated in the same way.
						This intermediate format therefore has to be rich
						enough to support a variety of output formats,
						whilst being agnostic about the actual language
						being rendered.

						To add a new backend then is simply a question of
						providing a function to walk this tree and
						render the appropriate output given a provided formatter

						<ul>
							<li>Item (module, includes, values, methods, etc)</li>
							<li>Annotated code (code with extra metadata)</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>New backends simply traverse values of these types</li>
				</ul>
				<aside class="notes">
					<p>Traditional document representations such as pandoc's
						internal data types usually have a split between block

					</p>
					<p>Code is naturally more hierarchical than this so
						we have more of a tree structure, but broadly we
						have the same sort of split. We have 'Items', which are the equivalent
						to blocks and contain headings, documentation blocks,
						as well as declarations such as modules, type and
						values. We also represent 'includes' at this level
						to enable these the HTML renderer to interactively
						allow them to be opened or closed.</p>

					<p>The declarations are then constructed from
						'Annotated code', which represents code with
						additional metadata associated with it. This
						additional metadata may be a documentation block,
						an alternative representation - for example, modules

						being an abbreviated "sig ... end", or possibly a path

						I'd like to talk a bit now about our future plans for odoc.
						It's an exciting time as with these recent improvements
						we're now in an excellent position to make some really interesting
						advances!</p>

					<p>The first thing We've got planned is moving the rendering of standard
						library
						documentation for the OCaml manual to odoc and slowly deprecating ocamldoc.
						It's
						likely this will follow a similar path to camlp4 - moving it
						out of the main ocaml repository to be maintained separately.
						I'd be very interested to hear from anyone for whom this will
						present any challenges - we're eager to work with people to find
						solutions, so please get in touch!
					</p>

					<p> We'd like to add search to
						odoc soon. This will likely depend upon handling implementation
						as well as interface files in order that
						we can rank the results according to amount of usage.
					</p>

					<p>We'd like to revamp docs.ocaml.org as a central repository of
						docs for all versions of packages. This is an interesting
						challenge, not least because the contents of a package is
						dependent not just upon its own version, but quite possibly
						on the versions of the packages it depends upon.
					</p>

					<p>How we will integrate with the rest of the OCaml documentation ecosystem,
						for example, mdx, is also something we'd like to address. For
						example, we're
						currently looking at mapping beetwen odoc syntax and mdx. Perhaps
						also even merlin for looking up docstrings?
					</p>
